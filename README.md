# Song-recommendation-based-on-facial-expression
This is a mini web application build with stream-lit (Python framework) , It facilitated with database  authentication , login and logout. In it's facial capture and emotion detection feature build using already deep learning will capture the dominate emotion and based on emotion system will recommend 6 song.

# Modules
## 1. DeepFace
This module is responsible for facial expression recognition using deep learning techniques. It analyzes the user's facial expression in real-time to determine their mood.

## 2. Haar Cascade Algorithm
The Haar cascade algorithm is utilized for face detection. It detects and locates faces within images or video frames, which is crucial for the facial expression recognition process.

## 3. Streamlit
Streamlit is used for building the user interface. It provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with the application, allowing users to log in, register, and receive song recommendations based on their facial expressions.
